# Twilio Setup Guide for VitaNips SOS Feature

## Current Issue
Your `.env` file has:
```
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+2348149960190
```

This appears to be your personal phone number, NOT a Twilio phone number. Twilio requires you to send SMS from a Twilio-owned phone number.

## Error Encountered
```
Twilio Error 21266: 'To' and 'From' number cannot be the same
```

This happens when your emergency contact's number is the same as your Twilio sender number.

## Solution: Get a Twilio Phone Number

### Option 1: Trial Account (Free - For Testing)

1. **Log in to Twilio Console**
   - Go to: https://console.twilio.com/

3. **Update Your .env File**
   ```bash
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15551234567  # Replace with your Twilio trial number
   ```

4. **Limitations of Trial Account**

   ```bash
   # TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   # TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   # TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
   ```

2. **The system will:**

   - ‚úÖ Return success response
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip actual SMS sending
   - üìù Add note: "SMS not sent: Twilio service not configured"

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER: +2348149960190 ‚ùå (This should be a Twilio number)
```

## Steps to Fix Right Now

### Quick Fix (Recommended for Testing):

1. **Find your Twilio trial number:**
   ```bash
   # Log in to: https://console.twilio.com/
   # Navigate to: Phone Numbers > Manage > Active Numbers
   # Copy your trial number (should look like: +1 XXX XXX XXXX)
   ```

2. **Update .env file:**
   ```bash
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1XXXXXXXXXX  # Your Twilio trial number
   ```

3. **Verify your emergency contact numbers:**
   - Add your emergency contact numbers as verified caller IDs
   - This allows them to receive SMS during trial

4. **Restart Django server:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Test SOS again**

## Testing After Fix

### 1. Add Emergency Contact
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/emergency/contacts/
{
  "name": "Test Contact",
  "relationship": "Friend",
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",  # Use a verified number for trial
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```

### 2. Trigger SOS
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/emergency/trigger_sos/
{
  "latitude": 40.7128,
  "longitude": -74.0060,
  "message": "Testing SOS after Twilio fix"
}
```

### 3. Check Logs
You should see:
```
‚úì SMS sent to Test Contact (+1234567890), SID: SM..., Status: queued
```

Instead of:
```
‚úó Error sending SMS to Test Contact: 'To' and 'From' number cannot be the same
```
